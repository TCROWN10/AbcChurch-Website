          <h4 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-2">Loving the "Unlovable": God's Call Beyond Comfort</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Some people are hard to hug‚Äîprickly personalities, hurtful histories, or bitter behaviors can make them feel unreachable. Yet, God's love calls us to love beyond limits, beyond logic, and beyond likes. Jesus didn't just die for the delightful; He died for the difficult too. Loving the unlovable isn't about them‚Äîit's about reflecting Jesus. Here are some ways to show Love to the "Unlovable":</p>
          
          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-1">1. Care, Even When They're Cold</h5>
            <p className="mb-1 text-sm md:text-base"><span className="font-semibold">Cold hearts need consistent care.</span></p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Just like a frozen heart needs time to thaw, persistently caring even when you get no warmth back can melt through bitterness. Be kind to all not minding who they are - the rude co-worker or distant neighbor‚Äîyour care may be the only Christ they will ever encounter. Proverbs 15:1a says, "A gentle answer turns away wrath‚Ä¶"</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-1">2. Pray, Even If They Push You Away</h5>
            <p className="mb-1 text-sm md:text-base"><span className="font-semibold">Persistent prayer pierces pride.</span></p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Intercession does what interaction sometimes can't. Praying softens both their heart and yours. Stop talking about others rather, talk to God for others. Remember, when Job prayed for his friends who misjudged him, God restored all he ever lost by double (Job 42:10)</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-1">3. Forgive, Even If They Frown</h5>
            <p className="mb-1 text-sm md:text-base"><span className="font-semibold">Forgiveness frees the forgiver.</span></p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Sometimes the unlovable are also unforgiving. But forgiveness isn't about feeling‚Äîit's about faithfulness to the Lord. A family member may never say sorry or be apologetic, however, your release of resentment gladens God's heart and invites His peace. Mercy is ministry. "Forgive one another‚Ä¶ as God in Christ forgave you." (Ephesians 4:32)</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-1">4. Help, Even When They Hurt You</h5>
            <p className="mb-1 text-sm md:text-base"><span className="font-semibold">Healers help even when it hurts.</span></p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">The unlovable might lash out because of past wounds. Loving them is planting seeds of love, remember, not all seeds grow overnight. Even Jesus washed Judas' feet, despite the fact that he knows he was still going to betray him. You're actually not helping because they deserve it‚Äîyou're helping because God deserves obedience. We love not by natural reaction, but by supernatural direction.</p>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-1">5. See Value, Even In Their Violence</h5>
            <p className="mb-1 text-sm md:text-base"><span className="font-semibold">See soul before scars.</span></p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Beneath harshness lies a hurting human‚Äîstill made in God's image. Loving them is choosing to look beyond their behavior. If Saul the persecutor became Paul the preacher, then no one is too bad for God to change, never underestimate God's grace plan. Grace gives what's undeserved to those who don't request it. "Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." (1 Samuel 16:7)</p>
