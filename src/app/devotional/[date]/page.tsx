          <p className="mb-4 text-sm md:text-base">Have you ever felt that you were not as close to God as you used to be? There are certain warning signs in our spiritual life that indicate we are slowly drifting away from God. When we are aware of the warning signs, we are able to remedy the unhealthy attitudes and behaviors that lead us away from the Lord. Here are some of the reasons:</p>
          
          <div className="mb-4">
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-2 text-[#FF602E]">1. A Decrease in Your Quiet Time</h4>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Any healthy relationship requires quality time to thrive. Our relationship with God is no different. Spending time with God by reading His word and praying is a great privilege and tool to strengthen our faith and keep our hearts focused. If you notice the following, beware:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 md:ml-6 mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">
              <li>You don't have quiet time with God.</li>
              <li>You don't want to have quiet time with God.</li>
              <li>You no longer see the value of having quiet time with God.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Losing the desire to spend time with God is the first telltale sign that something is not right spiritually.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-2 text-[#FF602E]">2. A Loss of Conviction</h4>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. (1 Timothy 4:1-2).</p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Our conscience is one of the main channels through which God gets our attention. We must not succumb to attitudes that eventually harden the heart. Some common, unhealthy excuses for hardness of the heart may include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 md:ml-6 mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">
              <li>"I deserve this."</li>
              <li>"I'm not as bad as others."</li>
              <li>"Everyone struggles."</li>
              <li>"I'm not as bad as I used to be."</li>
              <li>"I'll ask for forgiveness tomorrow." etc</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">A hardness of heart, or seared conscience, is a natural condition for human beings to fall into. It can often be a direct result of a lack of repentance. As pursuers of God, we ought to be sensitive to our conscience and sincere about correcting bad patterns of thought so as to honor God (Matthew 12:34b).</p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">If you spend more time devising excuses than repenting for sinful thoughts and actions, you are actually saying God's standards is faulty and that His opinion does not matter.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-2 text-[#FF602E]">3. When You Lose Confidence in Prayer</h4>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: (Matthew 7:7 NIV)</p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">When you doubt that God is interested in answering your prayers, you may begin to doubt that He is interested in you at all. But He is interested in you. The question is: are you interested in hearing what He has to say?</p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Praying for others is also a vital habit for Christians. Do you often fail to pray for people when you promise to pray for them, or do you typically follow through? If you find that prayer matters less and less to you, it is time to start taking counteractive steps to fix this issue.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-sm md:text-base mb-2 text-[#FF602E]">4. A Loss of Compassion for Those in Pain</h4>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (Ephesians 4:32 ESV)</p>
            <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">God may bring people into your life who are suffering or going through hardships that you might serve them. When you refuse to sympathize and help those in need, it could be a pointer of an hardened and a backsliding heart. Not only will you be missing important opportunities to serve, you will also be missing the opportunities to demonstrate your faith practically. And if you are not willing to demonstrate your faith practically, its like saying your faith is no longer important to you. (Matthew 25:34-40).</p>

          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Love isn't always comfortable‚Äîit's often costly. Jesus didn't just love the lovable; He loved the unlovable, the outcast, the sinner. His love wasn't conditional on behavior or reciprocation. It was a choice, a commitment, a covenant.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">When we love only those who love us back, we're no different from the world. But when we love the unlovable, we become like Christ. We become His hands, His feet, His heart in a broken world.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Today, ask yourself: Who is the "unlovable" person in your life? Who needs your love, even if they don't deserve it? Remember, you were once unlovable too, but God loved you anyway.</p>

          <h3 className="font-bold text-base md:text-lg mb-2 text-[#FF602E]">ü™ô 1. Sow to Grow ‚Äì Not Just to Go</h3>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Kingdom giving is spiritual sowing, not casual spending. You don't "lose" when you give; you launch your seed into soil that grows spiritual dividends and earthly returns. The Bible in 2 Corinthians 9:6 (NIV) says,</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base italic">Whoever sows generously will also reap generously.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">The world says, "save to gain," but the Word says, "sow to grow." God's economy responds to faithful flow, not fearful hoarding.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">If you want more in store, be a Kingdom sower, not a selfish storer.</p>

          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Giving is a life-giving grace that echoes into eternity. You may leave wealth, but giving lets you live well‚Äîeven beyond your years, for "It is more blessed to give than to receive." (Acts 20:35 KJV)</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Your gift is your gospel‚Äîit testifies of God's grace in you. Givers live loudly even in silence. For instance, Steve Jobs left billions‚Äîbut givers like Mother Teresa left blessings. Learn to not just leave a will, live a witness‚Äîby what you give.</p>

          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. (Matthew 6:33 KJV)</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Don't be mansion-minded, rather be mission-moved. Kingdom projects aren't about building empires but about empowering eternity.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">What you give to earthly buildings may fade, but what you give to heavenly missions will stand forever.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Many invest in luxury, few in legacy. Be part of the few.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base italic">Note: Don't just build mansions on earth‚Äîfund miracles for Heaven.</p>

          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base italic">Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?" (Haggai 1:4 NIV)</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">When you prioritize God's house, God prioritizes your home. Giving is not subtraction‚Äîit's spiritual construction.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">The surest and the fastest way to fix your finances is to fund God's work and family. The foundation of divine fortune is often buried in the funding of God's projects or house.</p>

          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops. (Proverbs 3:9 NIV)</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Giving isn't a transaction, it's a transformation. Every gift is a glorious graft into God's eternal purpose.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Giving is not a burden; it's a holy act of adoration for your gift, it isn't just a currency, it's a confession of trust in God.</p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm md:text-base">Worship without giving is like a lamp without oil‚Äîyou're present but not impactful.</p>
