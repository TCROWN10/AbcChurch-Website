## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send email" Error

**Problem:** SMTP credentials are wrong or not set

**Solutions:**
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. For Gmail: Make sure you're using an **App Password**, not your regular password
3. For Gmail: Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
4. Check for typos in email addresses
5. Make sure `SMTP_PORT` is a number (587 or 465)

### Emails Going to Spam

**Solutions:**
1. **Use a verified domain** (SendGrid/Resend)
2. **Add SPF/DKIM records** to your domain DNS
3. **Use your own domain** instead of Gmail (for production)
4. **Ask recipients to mark as "Not Spam"**

### Emails Not Arriving

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Vercel environment variables are set
2. ‚úÖ Environment variables are in Production environment
3. ‚úÖ Site has been redeployed after adding variables
4. ‚úÖ Check spam folder
5. ‚úÖ Check Vercel function logs for errors

### "Connection timeout" Error

**Solutions:**
1. Try port `465` instead of `587`
2. Check firewall settings
3. Try a different email service
