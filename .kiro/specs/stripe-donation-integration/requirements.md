# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Stripe payment processing into the existing donation page of the All Believers Christian Church website. The integration will replace the current signin redirect with a complete payment flow that supports both one-time and recurring donations across multiple giving categories. The solution will provide a secure, user-friendly donation experience while maintaining the existing UI design and animations.

2. WHEN a user clicks the Submit button for a one-time donation THEN the system SHALL redirect to Stripe Checkout with the specified amount and category
3. WHEN a user completes payment successfully THEN Stripe SHALL redirect back to a success page with donation confirmation

**User Story:** As a church administrator, I want to track donations by category and payment method, so that I can generate accurate financial reports and understand giving patterns.

### Requirement 6

#### Acceptance Criteria
